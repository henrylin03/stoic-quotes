## What is Stoicism?

According to Ryan Holiday, who runs [Daily Stoic](https://dailystoic.com/), the definition of Stoicism is:
> We don't control what *happens* to us, but we control how we *respond* to what happens to us in this life
>
Here is a video of Ryan explaining it in a bit more detail:

Here is an alternate video from TED-Ed:

Personally, Stoicism - especially Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations* - has provided the most impactful philosophical thoughts on my life, especially during tumultuous times. I want to share both my love for the Stoics, and the guidance it provided me, through this project. I hope it provides you solace as it did for me.
